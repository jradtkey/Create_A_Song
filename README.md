# Create A Beat/Song
I made this app with the idea of allowing for quick and easy song writing for non-musicians, musicians and vocalists who are looking to inspire themselves. The goal of this product is for it to be a platform for people to share their tracks online for others to use and collaborate with. Think of it as open-source music.

###### Next steps:
1. Adding way more audio tracks.
2. Categorizing and organizing tracks by key signature and beats per minute.
3. Adding a database for users to upload and save tracks.
4. Totally revamping the look and feel of the site.
